# Drumkit
Turns your keyboard (A-L) into a drumkit.

This was my first project ever using JavaScript and took me a full day to complete. At the time, JavaScript was really difficult for me to wrap my head around and understand, which is why I'm so glad to have completed this project because not only do I have a fully functioning, finished product - but I also understand JS much better now.
